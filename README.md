# Temperature Converter

A simple temperature converter built with React.

## Overview

This project is a temperature converter application that allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for entering temperature values in either Celsius or Fahrenheit and instantly seeing the converted value.

Main features include:

- Input fields for entering temperature values in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Real-time conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

  
   git clone <repository-url>


2. Install the dependencies:


   npm install


3. Start the development server:


   npm start


4. Open the application in your browser:


   http://localhost:3000


## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React application structure:

- `public`: Contains the public assets and the `index.html` file.
- `src`: Contains the application source code.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the application.
  - `App.js`: Main component that renders the temperature converter.
  - `Celsius.js`: Component for handling Celsius temperature input.
  - `Fahrenheit.js`: Component for handling Fahrenheit temperature input.
  - `styles.css`: CSS styles for the application.

## Components

### App

The `App` component is the main component of the application. It manages the state for both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature values and handles the conversion logic. It renders the `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` components and passes the necessary props to them.

### Celsius

The `Celsius` component is responsible for rendering the Celsius temperature input field. It receives the `celsius` value and `onCelsiusChange` callback function as props. When the input value changes, it calls the `onCelsiusChange` function to update the Celsius value in the `App` component.

### Fahrenheit

The `Fahrenheit` component is responsible for rendering the Fahrenheit temperature input field. It receives the `fahrenheit` value and `onFahrenheitChange` callback function as props. When the input value changes, it calls the `onFahrenheitChange` function to update the Fahrenheit value in the `App` component.

## Styling

The styling for the application is defined in the `styles.css` file. It provides basic styles for the components and the overall layout.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need for a simple and intuitive temperature converter. It was developed as a learning exercise and follows best practices in React development.
